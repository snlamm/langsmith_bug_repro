### Setup

To Run this example, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in root and set the following variables:

```
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="your-key"
LANGSMITH_PROJECT_NAME="your-project-name"
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
```

2. from root, run `yarn` and then `yarn dev`

3. hit the following GET endpoint: `http://localhost:3002/ai/trigger`

### Outcome:

You'll notice the following:

There are 3 api calls to openai:

1. the first one succeeds (logs results to console _and_ langsmith), using a tracer callback handler in an array

Then in the trace group:

2. the second one stays in pending forever in langsmith (logs results to console, remains in _pending_ forever in langsmith), using callback _manager_ in an array

3. the third one succeeds (logs results to console _and_ langsmith), using callback manger _not_ in an array

There are no type errors.

This replicates 100% of the time (out of ~20 or so attempts, some of them separated >12 hours apart).

### The Difference Between the Calls

The issue here is that when the callback _manager_ is put in an array, it silently fails with no explanation to the end-user by logging that the run started but silently failing to update it.
In addition, there are no type errors.

Fix: either create a clear warning/error when a user attempts to pass a manager in an array, or changing the callback logic so it can handle a callback manager in an array correctly.
